            <h3>Findings about Women in Tech</h3>
            <p>It's no secret that there aren't as many women in tech as there are men and that good female role models can be thin on the ground.Female leaders are happy to share their experiences and help shape the future careers of others. The problem has been that when it comes to working mothers in technology, women often fall into one of two camps.They are either female leaders, who are high achievers and continuing to climb the career ladder successfully, with the balance tipped more towards work than family life. Or they are those that are happy to take a step back in their careers whilst focussing on family.Either camp is great if that works for you, but for me, I felt stuck in the middle - I wanted to continue to progress whilst also being there to pick the children up from childcare and tuck them into bed.</p>

            <p>"Recognize and embrace your uniqueness...Being a Black woman, being a woman in general, on a team of all men, means that you are going to have a unique voice. It's important to embrace that." - Erin Teague<br>"I think it's very important to get more women into technology. My slogan is: Technology is too important to be left to men."- Resty Stimelah</p>
